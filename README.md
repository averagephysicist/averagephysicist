- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julian Cortez. I am a physicist from Colombia. I am currently studying a masters in physics at USP, Brazil. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and AI, although I find coding in general as something very interesting and enjoyable. I'm a complete beginer and I want to use my Github account to keep track of my learning process. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of coding using Python language since it is easy for beginners and used in ML and AI.
